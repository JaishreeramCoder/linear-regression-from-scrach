# Linear Regression from Scratch

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using Python without using built-in regression functions from libraries like `sklearn`.

## Features

- Implements Linear Regression without using built-in regression models.
- Uses NumPy for mathematical computations.
- Preprocesses data (handling categorical values, feature scaling).
- Splits data into training and testing sets.


## Dataset

The notebook uses `Student_Performance.csv` with 10,000 rows and 5 features, which contains:

- Independent variables (features related to students)
- Dependent variable: `Performance Index`
